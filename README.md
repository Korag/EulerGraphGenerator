# EulerGraphGenerator

On the basis of the created program, a scientific article was written and published:

Czepielik Ł., Haręża K., Korzonkiewicz K., Wróbel B. (2019) Transformation of randomly generated non-directed graph into eulerian graph and determination of eulerian cycle. In:  Zawiślak S., Rysiński J. (eds) Processing, transmission and security of information - 2019 vol. 2. Wydawnictwo Naukowe Akademii Techniczno-Humanistycznej (http://www.engineerxxi.ath.eu/book/processing-transmission-and-security-of-information-2019-vol-2/)

The developed application solves the problem of transforming a randomly generated graph into an Eulerian graph and determining the Euler cycle.

Stages of program operation:

1. Customization of the graph generator parameters
2. Execution of the transformation sequence to convert the graph to the Eulerian graph
3. Visualization of the transformed graph together with highlighting the existing Euler cycle
